# crypto_patents
A open source collection of crypto patents.

--------

To start any meaningful adoption in the crypto space, this repository was created to gain an overview of blockchain related patents.
In a subsequent second step, we will then merge all found patents into a database file and share it on an open-source website. 

### Contribute

To contribute, please fork the repo and add the patents to a csv file including ```Inventor, Assignee, App/Pub Number, Application Status``` to the "collections" folder. Via pull request you can add those files to this core repository. 


### Other

If you want to start your own platform ontop of the here accumulated database, feel free to do that.
